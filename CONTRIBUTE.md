## Before working on an issue
If you would like to work on an issue and if it has no assignees
assign it to you and work on it. If you would like to work on an issue
already assigned to someone please communicate clearly with the
assignees before putting any working in it.

## Working on an issue
When you want to work on an issue assigned to you, make sure you work
on a branch dedicated to that issue. When you fixed an issue create a
pull request for your changes to get reviewed and at the end to be
merged into the master branch.
